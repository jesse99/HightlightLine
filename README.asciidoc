HighLightLine 1.0
=================

HighLightLine is an extension for Visual Studio 2010 that sets the background color of the current line
to a user settable value. It's based on the http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/0cc4c4c5-0f0b-4c6b-a269-3e0c1603d516[LineAdornments]
addon except that HighlightLine:

* Doesn't add a border around the current line.
* Does not highlight lines if the selection crosses multiple lines.

To change the highlight color open the Options item in the Tools menu, go to the Environment
tab, select "Current Line" from the Display Items list, and set the background color.

To install exit studio and double-click the vsix file. To uninstall use the Extension Manager 
item in the Tools menu,
