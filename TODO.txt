* Probably should push to github.
* Drop in the LineAdornment code.
* Make sure that it builds and runs.
* Get rid of the black border (distracting and screws up insertion point when it is at the start of a line).
* Only draw the adornment if the selection is entirely within a single line.
* Adornment height is sometimes wrong. When the document uses different fonts?
* Review the manifest.
* Add an asciidoc readme.
* Release on github.
* Release on the gallery.
